## Some helper functions that are used in the game



# MQS plugin helper function to know if quest is already active
# We can use this to avoid adding the same quest twice in cases where a quest
# can be activated in different places
# It checks if the quest was already completed or failed too!
# But I can't change the name of it, because I already used it in a lot of events!
