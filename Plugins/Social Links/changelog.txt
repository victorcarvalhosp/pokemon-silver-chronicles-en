===Change Log===
1.3.1
- New feature: Free Market NPC support. Added support for adding Buyer-specific Parameters to SocialLinkProfile definitions so Social Links can purchase player lots if using the Free Market plugin.

1.3
- New feature: Catch Rate Boosts. You can now add :CatchRate as a :bond_effect, to alter the Catch Rates for Pokémon when you reach certain Bond levels with Social Links. Just like the other :bond_effect types, this requires manual code changes to be supported. These changes are described in the Setup and Document guide.
- Fixed bond effect messages so they use the properly capitalized name of the affected type, instead of all caps ("ELECTRIC-type" => "Electric-type").

1.2
- New feature: Moments. Moments can be used as a way to track whether or not a Social Link is ready to increase their Bond with the player. The can increase for minor things that help improve your relationship with a Social Link. You can think of these as hidden points for granular interactions with Social Links. Using these is completely optional.
Example uses as minor positive experiences that can lead to increasing Bond with them later on:
- Choosing a positive response choice when talking to a Social Link
- Healing a Social Link's Pokémon while in a partner double battle
- Buying an item from a Social Link

The Setup and Documentation guide has been updated to include information and functions related to Moments.

1.1 
- New feature: NPC Specific Max Bond. You can now set bond_max as a parameter to override the default BOND_LEVEL_MAX for an NPC, allowing for different NPCs to have different max bond levels.
- New feature: NPC Specific Bond Icon Positions. You can now set bond_icon_coords as a parameter to override the default positions of bond icons for an NPC. This can be used with bond_max to make the Social Media Profile UI look cleaner for different max bond levels.
